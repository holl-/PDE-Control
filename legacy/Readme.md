## Naming differences between paper and code

| Name in paper                 | Name in code            |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Observation predictor (OP)    | Slow motion (SM)        |
| Control force estimator (CFE) | Inverse kinematics (IK) |
| Staggered execution           | Binary tree             |
| Prediction refinement         | Interleaved tree        |
| Reconstructed trajectory      | Real sequence           |


## Code by experiment
